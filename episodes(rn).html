			<h3>Episode 1: Don't Call Me Nelly</h3>
			<p>Outlaw Isambard Tulley and his gang rob a carriage in the forest, but are run off by Nell Jackson, returning home widowed from war after being absent for many years, and magically bestowed with recurring superhuman strength. Once home with her father, Sam Trotter, and two little sisters, Roxy and George, she eventually receives a warm reception. The party in her honor is crashed by Thomas Blancheford, cruel son of the local magistrate, whom Nell fights over his harassment of Roxy. After an initial struggle, she beats and humiliates Thomas. That night, Nell is woken by Billy Blind, a fairy who has been granting her superhuman strength for reasons unknown even to himself. Thomas seeks help with his accrued debts from Robert Hennessey, Earl of Poynton, who possesses knowledge of the dark arts. Poynton gradually suggests that Thomas must prove himself, and Thomas proceeds to murder Nell’s father. While Thomas’ father, Lord Blancheford, takes measures to cover up the crime, Rasselas, their footman, informs Nell’s sisters of the truth. They go to the city to find Nell, who has been prevented from joining the army, and has encountered Isambard Tulley, here going by the name “Charles Devereux.” Nell is advised by Billy Blind to seek justice through the proper channels. The sisters return to the Blancheford estate, where Lord Blancheford offers them tenancy of the family tavern in exchange for their silence. He later reneges on this deal at Thomas’ urging. Nell returns to demand Lord Blancheford prosecute Thomas, and after he agrees, Thomas shoots him in the head. Thomas blames Nell for the murder and is supported by his sister Sofia, to the disbelief of Rasselas. Together, Rasselas and Nell escape, gather Nell's sisters and go on the run.</p>

			<h3>Episode 2: Tracks Less Well Trod</h3>
			<p>Nell hijacks a carriage, and as she robs the passengers, Billy reveals he has obligations to protect her, although he dissembles as to why. As the authorities, including Thomas and Sofia, make plans to capture Nell, she decides to head west to leave Roxy and George with their uncle and continue on to America. Back at the mansion, Poynton congratulates Thomas on murdering his father and says he shows promise. Roxy talks about her crush on Rasselas and relays his past as an enslaved prince of Benin, when her story is interrupted by Charles Devereux. He tells Nell about the new bounty on her head and warns her against leaving her sisters with family, suggesting they team up instead. Nell reluctantly agrees and they head to a nearby inn disguised as a noble retinue. Following Lord Blancheford's funeral, Sofia and Poynton discuss Nell's supernatural powers and he offers his assistance in her capture. Nell and her party's disguise is rumbled by an employee of the inn, who reveals to the Blanchefords that they're visiting a local lord. Hunters are dispatched, accompanied by Sofia. Poynton, on hearing this, summons an antlered rider from underground. Roxy and George spy the incoming cavalry and run to warn Nell. Billy advises Nell that accepting the lord's invitation is a bad idea, but she ignores him and follows Charles inside.</p>

The group comes across an abandoned plague village in the woods and takes shelter, where Nell tends to George.

			<h3>Episode 4: Devil's Dung</h3>
			<p>Nell enlists help in a local town from an old doctor by posing as a Scottish aristocrat. Roxy finds an old text about a healing ointment, but the ingredients sound fantastical. She is guided by magic which helps her make it. She later admits to Nell that she thinks she possesses magical powers. Poynton persuades Sofia that he should move in with her and Thomas, but Thomas is against the idea and he leaves for London. Back at the village, the doctor examines George and discovers the ointment Roxy mixed helped, but he wants to perform surgery to ensure she fully recovers. In the process, he discovers Nell is a wanted outlaw and suggests that she visit his brother, a magistrate, in Oxford to secure a fair hearing. Charles, now trapped in Newgate prison, meets Lady Eularia, an older high-class woman. She accosts him for his misdeeds and reveals that they're engaged, but declines to help him until he tells her the truth. Poynton agrees to tutor Sofia in dark magic in order to murder Nell, if she agrees to overthrow the queen and support the Jacobite cause. They plan to back an army James Francis Edward Stuart will be bringing over from France in a few weeks. Nell goes to Oxford and relays her side of the story to the magistrate, who dies in front of her from an unknown cause, but Nell still ends up accused of murdering him.</p>

			<h3>Episode 5: Excuse Me, I'm a Doctor</h3>
			<p>Nell drops off George and Roxy at their uncle Jack's inn and leaves with Rasselas for London. As her abilities grow, Sofia plans on executing a complex and laborious spell to locate and trap Nell with Poynton's guidance. The spell requires a subterranean space and an object belonging to Nell - fortunately, Sofia had taken a comb with Nell's hair from the scene of the fight with Herne. Billy refuses to help Nell spring Charles from prison, as it goes against his morals to help a criminal. Rasselas asks Nell permission to court Roxy, but she refuses, saying Roxy is too young. Afterwards, Nell impersonates a doctor and infiltrates the prison. She discovers an outbreak of typhus and uses it as an excuse to visit Charles, who has become an exhibit for the nobles. He rejects her plan to get him out, counting on Lady Eularia to secure his freedom. Eularia figures out that the doctor examining Charles was actually Nell and informs the guards, who trick Nell and lock her up with child prisoners. Billy declares that their true mission is to free the children that were cruelly imprisoned for petty crimes, and he grants Nell her powers to break them out, as well as other prisoners held in squalor. Meanwhile, Sofia summons black ooze from the prison walls and ground in an attempt to hinder Nell. As the prisoners escape, Rasselas runs in to find Nell. In a final attempt, Sofia creates illusory barriers, but Nell runs through them and awakens outside, finding that Rasselas has disappeared. During the night, George is kidnapped by the traveling performer Japhia.</p>

			<p>Polly Honeycombe, a noblewoman who had been robbed by Nell, elopes with one Mr. Scribble. She fantasizes about Nell, who she believes is a man, and convinces herself that Nell is courting her. She is then kidnapped by Japhia's troupe, who believe her to be Roxy. Returning to her uncle's inn, Nell learns about the kidnappings and sets off with Roxy to save George. Poynton returns from London with Thomas, helping him overcome his patricidal guilt by gifting him an artefact of dark magic. Rasselas appears at the Blancheford estate as well.

Sofia and Poynton discuss their plans, while Rasselas spies on them. Japhia attempts to force Nell to drink poison, but Billy foils his plan by switching their drinks. Then Nell helps one of the troupe performers give birth. Afterwards, Polly kisses her dramatically, but Nell seems surprised and chooses to ignore it. Giving a rousing speech, Nell declares war on the press that has been slandering her entire family. Rasselas confronts Sofia and pleads with her to tell the truth.

			<h3>Episode 7: Stop Printing This Muck</h3>
			<p>Nell and her group arrive in London, where she's infamous amongst the townspeople. Instead of destroying the newspaper presses, Billy suggests they use them to their advantage. The group is reunited with Rasselas as they attempt to convince Lady Eularia, who is a news magnate, that Nell is innocent, and that Sofia and Poynton are planning a coup. At his trial, Charles shifts the blame onto Nell to save himself, but his defense is thrown off course when the prosecution accuses him of being a Jacobite and he's abandoned by Eularia. When the rest of the plotters arrive to convene with Poynton, Sofia is excluded for being a woman, while Thomas, despite his minimal involvement, is welcomed into the ranks. Sofia then discovers the secret underground room used for rituals in Poynton's office and decides to take advantage of it. Eularia refuses to retract the lies she's been writing in her newspapers, so Nell threatens to destroy her printing presses. Eularia is then possessed by Sofia, using her to attack Nell. George sings a song defending Nell and shedding light on the truth, which manages to break the spell. Sofia bursts into the room where the Jacobite meeting is being held and reveals that Nell and her allies know about the planned invasion, moving up their timetable. Charles is found guilty at his trial, but escapes. Eularia finally agrees to print the truth and hires Polly as her new editor. Receiving news of the queen's relocation to the Blancheford residence at Poynton's urging, Nell and her group rush to save her.</p>

			<h3>Episode 8: Not Some Cheap Trick</h3>
			<p>Billy is excited to intercept the queen during her trip, but instead they find Charles in a decoy carriage. Poynton arrests the queen upon her arrival at the Blancheford residence. When Sofia finds out about the pendant Poynton gifted Thomas, she confronts him and learns that the effects of the pendant could unlock immeasurable power, at the cost of Thomas' life. Sofia refuses to harvest the power, so Poynton does it himself, and he leaves Sofia to die as a snake coils around her body. Rasselas agrees to help Roxy find a way in to confront the dark forces she senses are operating inside. When they find Thomas, he reveals Rasselas' true name to be Amadin. Nell fights off all the guards to get to the queen, who is then revealed to be Poynton in disguise. He overpowers Nell with his newfound magic.
